My first Decentralized application on Ethereum
This file contains a simple front-end website , a created and deployed Solidity smart contract connected together with the help of MetaMask, Remix IDE, and Ethers.js. I have created a simple front-end with two buttons that can react with smart contract functions

Prerequisites
    1. Download and setup MetaMask if you do not have it already
    2. Click on the User Icon at the top-right of MetaMask, go to Settings, and turn on Show Test Networks
    3. Click on Ethereum Mainnet at the top of MetaMask and change it to Sepolia test network
    4. Request some Sepolia Testnet ETH from a faucet like this one - Ethereum Sepolia Faucet | Free 0.1 sETH per day | LearnWeb3
    5. Install a code editor (We recommend Visual Studio Code)
    6. Install Node.js if you do not have it already (Use the LTS version, as that is stable. The latest version is experimental and may have bugs)
    7. Open up a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux) and install lite-server so you can run your website
npm install -g lite-server
